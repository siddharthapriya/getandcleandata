Class project
As part of the class project one is required to fetch data related to "Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones" and do the following operations on the data through a script

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject (this tidy_data need to be submitted)

Also following files need to be created
1. run_analysis.R which does the things mentioned above from point 1 to 5
2. README.md file (this repo explains how all of the scripts work and how they are connected) 
3. CodeBook.md (a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that you performed to clean up the data)
